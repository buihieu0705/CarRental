The hard-charging, high-revving twin-turbo straight-six eats up straightaways quicker than Kobayashi downs hot dogs. While we prepare for the extinction of manual transmissions, this little BMW still fights for the resistance. It offers a snappy dual-clutch automatic, too. Its harsh ride and unimpressive interior are less contentious on the more affordable M240i, but the true M car is terrific specifically because its an uncompromising drivers car. /The M2s snorty twin-turbo 3.0-liter inline-six is a sweetheart of an engine, and it pumps out 405 horsepower and 406 pound-feet of torque. That combination reaches the rear wheels via a standard six-speed manual transmission or an optional seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. The engine moves the M2 with an unbridled ferocity and creates stomach butterflies as you rev it to the 7600-rpm redline. Like an explicit scene from Fifty Shades of Grey, the M2s punishing ride needs a safe word. But there isnt one. Those willing to accept the abuse on regular roads will be rewarded with pure ecstasy on the track. There, the M2 handles like an extension of its driver, with gleefully violent thrust and a clairvoyant chassis. Harsh ride aside, the M2 is a phenomenal drivers car. Namby-pamby drivers who complain will find solace in the softer BMW M240i. Instead of the adaptive dampers available on most rivals, the BMW uses conventional passive shocks tuned the old-fashioned way. Too bad the electrically assisted power steering spoils some of the fun. The M2 has massive rotors and powerful binders that provide excellent pedal feedback that never fades.')

Three different powertrains are offered—including a plug-in hybrid model and a high-performance twin-turbo V-8—and the X5s road manners are decidedly athletic. Its styling is attractive without being overly flashy, and the interior treats occupants with quality materials, comfortable seats, and a plethora of convenience and luxury features. It faces heady competition from the likes of the Audi Q7, the Porsche Cayenne, and the Mercedes-Benz GLE-class, but the X5 is a richly outfitted package well-equipped for the task at hand. /For 2021 there are now three distinct powertrains, each associated with a different X5 model.

All three powertrains are paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission, and none of them will leave drivers wanting for power in virtually any driving situation. The X5s refined ride and stable handling are a big improvement compared with the previous-generation model, as is its steering, which feels more connected and direct but still not exactly what wed consider sporting. The Q7 still has the X5 beat in this area, but its a close match. Pitch the X5 into a fast corner, and it holds on reliably and rewards the driver with a predictability thats missing from the GLE-class.

While rivals such as the Mercedes-Benz GLA-class and Lexuss own UX merely give the illusion of being an SUV, the NX has the ride height and overall driving experience of the real thing. The NX knows how to pamper its occupants too, with a spacious cabin and an overall sense of luxury, even though its been around for a while compared to newer, more modern rivals such as the Cadillac XT4 and Volvo XC40. Cargo space is plentiful, and Lexus offers an optional hybrid powertrain for those seeking maximum fuel efficiency—just dont expect sporty handling from any NX model.	 /	While its acceleration wont blow the doors off any stoplight challengers, the 2021 NX should offer enough power for the casual driver. The NX300 (formerly known as the NX200t) comes with a 235-hp turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, a six-speed automatic, and front-wheel drive; all-wheel drive is also available. In our testing of an all-wheel-drive F Sport model, it performed a class-average 6.9-second zero-to-60-mph time. The Mercedes-Benz GLA250 4Matic managed to sprint to 60 mph in 5.8 seconds, making the NX seem positively sluggish. Its a different story on the road. The NX doesnt feel lethargic pulling into traffic, the engines power delivery is linear and predictable, and once the turbo kicks in, its even peppier. The hybrid powertrain provides even less pep, but its fuel economy is measurably improved. While the NX isnt as fun on a twisty road as the BMW X1 or the GLA250, its light steering makes it easy to pilot around town. Its center of gravity is higher than in either of those competitors, lending it a top-heavy feel when cornering.')

Rear-wheel drive is its only setup. We found the automatic to be a good match for the turbo four, but the engine isnt up to the task of pulling the RC around with any alacrity. Lexus offers two versions of its V-6 to address the lack of power. Under the hood of the all-wheel-drive RC300, the V-6 makes 255 horsepower and pairs with a six-speed automatic. The range-topping RC350 gets a 306-hp V-6 that teams up with the eight-speed automatic (RWD only) or the six-speed (AWD only). In our testing, weve found this engine to be velvety smooth with linear power delivery, but its still not as gutsy as its rivals. While it managed a 5.7-second run from zero to 60 mph, the BMW 440i coupe we tested did the deed in 4.4 seconds. Ride comfort is where the RC succeeds—and it does so with honors. Upgrading to larger wheels with lower profile tires, as featured on the RC350 F Sport we tested, does put a sharper edge on the ride, but it is never harsh. The RC is not as eager as tauter coupes when it comes to enthusiastic driving, but theres still some room to play. The steering wheel transmits a good amount of road feeling, and theres enough feedback to let you know when the front tires are losing their grip on the pavement.')
